## Convert these image types to WebP (lossless) using Img2WebP:
- PNG (*.png)
- APNG (*.png)
- JPEG 1 (*.jpeg, *.jpg, *.jpe, *.jfif, *.exif)
- JPEG 2000 (*.jp2, *.j2c, *.jpg2, *.jpf, *.jpx, *.j2k)
- JPEG XR (*.jxr, *.wdp, *.wmp)
- JPEG XL (*.jxl)
- BMP (*.bmp, *.dib, *.rle)
- TIFF (*.tiff, *.tif)
- TGA (*.tga)
- GIF (*.gif)
- AV1/AVIF (*.avif)
- HEIF (*.heic, *.heif)
- TGA (*.tga)

### Notes:
JPEG 1 is first losslessly converted to JPEG XL - which has the ability to do lossless JPEG 1 recompression - as an intermediate format to then losslessly convert to WebP. <br>
Without this intermediate format, JPEG 1 would lose quality upon being converted, even if it was supposed to be lossless. JPEG 1 is a volatile format.

To use the program, you may have to right click the file and unblock it.
